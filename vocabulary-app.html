        <h3>Vocabulary App Overview</h3>
        <h4>The Challenge</h4>
        <p>
          To create a vocabulary app that empowers users to learn new vocabulary. The app is
          targeted toward those who want to study on the go (5-10min study sessions.)
        </p>
        <h4>The Process</h4>
        <p>
          My goal was to take knowledge that I acquired through competitive analysis and user
          research to create a mobile app that gives users the tools needed to study new vocabulary efficiently. I first create a proto-persona to visualize my target audience, then plan how the core features of the app would function via user flows. These would then help me create wireframes which would then be used for rapid prototyping, where I used a tool called Marvel to bring life to my designs and have them undergo usability testing.
        </p>
        <h4>The Goal</h4>
        <p>
          A mobile app that provides users with the tools needed to learn new vocabulary 
          on the go. My role was to bring the project from the research phase up to and through 
          the usability testing phase. This project was completed via the CareerFoundry Intro to 
          UX Course.
        </p>
        <h4>Project Duration</h4>
        <p>
          1 Month
        </p>
        <h4>Tools Used</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Adobe XD</li>
          <li>Adobe Illustrator</li>
          <li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
          <li>Marvel</li>

       <h3>Understanding the User</h3>
       <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
       <p>
        To better understand my target audience, I performed a competitive analysis on three 
        vocabulary/study apps. This would provide me with knowledge of current pain points users are having with similar apps. The three apps I studied were Magoosh, “EN” by Visual App, and Quizlet.
        <br><br>
        I took notes on the design solutions I came across such as testing features, player versus player competitions, flash cards, and study guides. My approach to using each app was placing myself in the shoes of a student trying to learn vocabulary as soon as possible. 
        Through this approach, I determined that pre-made study guides were by far the quickest option for users to achieve this goal. Other opportunities to better the experience for users is through displaying the user’s progress and performance studying.
       </p>
       <h4>Interviews</h4>
       <p>
        Using the knowledge acquired through the above competitive analysis, I created an 
        interview script that would be used in five interviews. The questions asked would help 
        me gain further insight as to what each participant’s study habits are. Important quotes were recorded in each interview such as:
       </p>

         <img src="img/vocabulary-app/desktop/interview-quotes.png" alt="Interview Quotes">
       </picture>
       </div>
       <h4>Personas</h4>
       <p>
        Using the quotes and other knowledge pulled from the interviews, I created personas to 
        better understand the needs and wants of users. This also helped me develop a sense of 
        empathy for the user, which is crucial in designing rewarding experiences catered to specific target audiences. 
       </p>

       </div>
       <h4>Design Strategy</h4>
       <p>
        Before diving into design solutions, I refined the problem to a simple story reflecting the needs of my personas. This makes empathizing with my target audience easier, in addition to having a concrete strategy moving forward.
       </p>
       <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
       <p>
        Sarah needs a way to prepare for her Spanish exam efficiently because she wants to 
        maintain her 3.2 GPA to keep her scholarship while tending to her other responsibilities. 
        I will know this is true when we see that Sarah can study efficiently by having access to 
        the correct study material at any time.
       </p>
       <h4>Hypothesis Statement</h4>
       <p>
        I believe that by creating a vocabulary app that includes a database of course-specific study guides for Sarah, we will see Sarah pass her Spanish exam by learning the material 
        in less than two weeks, resulting in her maintaining a 3.2 GPA.
       </p>

       </div>
       <h3>Iterative Design</h3>
       <h4>User Flows</h4>
       <p>
        At this point in the design process, the goal is not only to assist Sarah in reaching her goals, but to help her reach her goals efficiently. User flows serve as a great tool to map 
        out the steps Sarah will need to take in order to reach her end goal. The two users flows below depict what Sarah’s journey in the vocabulary app will look like.
       </p>
       <h4>Flow #1</h4>

       </div>
       <h4>Wireframing</h4>
       <p>
        One of the most important parts of the design process is the testing phase. Wireframing marks the start of preparation for these usability tests. To test my solution, I first needed to visualize the screens that would make up the above user flows. Each low-fidelity wireframe lays out the information displayed via basic shapes and annotations.

       <h4>Marvel Prototype</h4>
       </div>
       <p>
        Each low-fidelity wireframe was then digitized via 
        <a href="https://marvelapp.com/prototype/9d39e95/screen/76915743" target="_blank" class="marvel-link">Marvel</a>
        and turned into a prototype 
        that would undergo usability testing. These tests would provide a great deal of insight 
        as to what solutions needed to be revisited as standard practice in iterative design.      
       </p>

       </picture>
       </div>
       <h4>Usability Test Overview</h4>
       <p>
        There were five participants for the usability tests. Tests consisted of scenarios where the participant would have to perform tasks utilizing some of the features in the vocabulary app. Each task was formatted as a scenario that made the test feel more organic:
       </p>
       <ol>
         <li>You have just downloaded the vocabulary app and would like to get started.</li>
         <li>You have an exam to prepare for and begin by creating a new guide and a flashcard.</li>
         <li>You’re running low on time to prepare for your exam and don’t have time to create a study guide. You decide finding an already made guide is the best option.</li>
         <li>You and some colleagues have decided to prepare for the exam together using the app. They invite you to share your guides through a chat in the app.</li>
       </ol>
       <h4>Usability Test Report</h4>
       <p>
        Each observation/error was categorized by severity, meaning how urgent it would be to 
        address it. In addition to ranking by severity, each observation includes a solution on how the app could be improved.
       </p>

       </picture>
       </div>
       <h4>Final Revisions</h4>
       <p>
        The final step I took for this project was incorporating the recommendations column in new wireframes. The most notable changes included making the home screen easier for users to scale by adding white space, and make the “create guide” button (plus button) easier to locate. Another important change was adding tabs to the groups screen to break information down by categories for users.

      <h3>In Conclusion</h3>
      <h4>Next Steps</h4>
      <p>
        Future plans include applying my new wireframes to an updated prototype for further 
        testing; and if need be, repeat the process again. I would also strive to make the app 
        more accessible, as well as begin to develop a brand and UI for the product. Once these
        steps are complete, I would then create a design language system for developers to 
        follow and hand off any necessary deliverables to the development team.
      </p>
      <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
      <p>
        I found myself having the most success during the wireframing phase. To me, information architecture is among the most enjoyable parts of the design process. On the contrary, I found crafting an interview script to be challenging. Futhermore, recruiting participants 
        was more difficult than I had imagined it would be. I improvised by utilizing my network within the UX community as well reaching out to friends and family. The interviews were 
        a success. The data I acquired proved to be of great use in crafting my design solution. 
        <br><br>
        I am thankful for having the opportunity to work on this project. I greatly enjoyed collaborating with my mentors and colleagues as I took my first step in becoming a UX Designer. Putting myself out there by conducting interviews and usability tests was a daunting, yet rewarding experience. The satisfaction of looking back at my first accomplished project is inexplicable. By developing a sense of empathy for users, my perspective has changed when interacting with products across all mediums. I now see the world in a different way, and I plan to continue to use these new-found skills in future projects. Thank you.
